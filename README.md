BlindSpot is a high-speed, hack-and-slash with fast paced and heavily speedrunnable gameplay, 4 bosses, and exciting abilities, and procedurally generated maps, you are thrown into a world where you are deprived of one of your core senses, Sight.

You perceive your world through LiDAR rays shooting out, using your newly received powers, bestowed upon you by Geuce Energy. You must pass through 80 levels, escaping the lab, using powers given to you in the lab accident in which you were blinded, to find the man who wronged you.
